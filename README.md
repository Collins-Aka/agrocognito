# Project Description
AgroCognito is a Climate-Smart Agriculture Platform designed to support smallholder farmers in Cameroon and beyond in adapting to climate change.

# Introduction
Climate change is one of the most pressing threats to global food security, with far-reaching consequences for the well-being of farmers, communities, and economies. In Cameroon, agriculture is a vital sector that employs over 70% of the workforce and contributes significantly to the country's GDP (FAO, 2020). However, climate change is altering rainfall patterns, increasing temperatures, and exacerbating pest and disease pressures, leading to reduced crop yields and decreased food security. This has devastating effects on the most vulnerable populations, particularly children, who are at risk of malnutrition, stunting, and increased vulnerability to climate-related illnesses. In fact, 1 in 5 children under 5 in Cameroon suffer from stunting due to chronic malnutrition (UNICEF, 2020). Globally, climate change is projected to reduce crop yields by up to 25% by 2050, threatening the livelihoods of millions of farmers and the food security of billions of people (IPCC, 2019). The stakes are high, and innovative solutions are needed to support farmers in adapting to a changing climate. This is where AgroCognito comes in â€“ a Climate-Smart Agriculture Platform designed to empower farmers in Cameroon with data-driven insights and climate-resilient practices, ultimately contributing to improved food security, nutrition, and well-being for communities, especially children.
